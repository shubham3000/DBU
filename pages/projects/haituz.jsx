          <h2>Ideation &amp; Construction</h2>
          <p>Hiatuz comes from the term hiatus, which means &quot;a halt or break in a sequence or activity.&quot; The logo features Hiatuz&lsquo;s initial letter H and a pause button, emphasising the brand&lsquo;s ambition to disrupt traditional educational methods. Because the courses they offer are just for electrical engineering, it&nbsp;also symbolizes the anode/cathode of an electric circuit.

          <h2>Colors &amp; Typeface</h2>
          <p>The hues are a fantastic match for each other. Yellow is associated with gained knowledge, as well as uplifting and illuminating qualities such as hope, happiness, cheerfulness, and joy. The colour black is utilised to create contrast, which corresponds to Hiatuz&lsquo;s unusual teaching style.
            <br />The typeface is&nbsp;Bebas&nbsp;which ensures a strong and bold brand identity.
