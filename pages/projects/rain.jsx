                            <p>The first challenge in this project was to create a simple, futuristic, and appealing company identity with a 3D element. We looked at a lot of different ideas before settling on this final design, which combines cubical 3d elements to depict a store with a door that also conveys the brand initials D in negative space. The bold square custom font is designed to complement the brand mark.</p>
